# Introduction

It is now possible to score sleep at equivalent performance to expert human-scored polysomonography (PSG) using only electrocardiography (ECG/EKG). Our method offers an inexpensive, automated, and convenient alternative for sleep stage classificationâ€”further enhanced by a real-time scoring option.

Our intention is that cardiosomnography (CSG), or a sleep study conducted with ECG/EKG only, could take expert-level sleep studies outside the confines of clinics and laboratories and into realistic settings. It makes less-expensive, higher-quality studies accessible to a broader community, enabling improved sleep research and more personalized, accessible sleep-related healthcare interventions.

# Repository

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adammj/ecg-sleep-staging) contains everything you need to do the following:

1. Score your own data
2. Prepare your data
3. Use the benchmark dataset
4. Use the loss function for your own models
5. Replicate everything in the paper's Methods and Results sections

If you need any assistance, please feel free to contact me (contact details provided in the paper). I will be happy to help you use and modify the code to work on your own data, as well as replicate anything from the paper.
